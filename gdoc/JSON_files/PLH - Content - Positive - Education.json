          "Message": "Step 3. Remember that you are a parent NOT a substitute teacher! \n\nYour role is to support your child by creating a space to learn. You do not need to know all the answers. Help them explore their interests and ask questions. Go at your child's pace and be patient with yourself. "

          "Message": "Step 4. Stay connected with your child's school and teachers\n\nFind out how to stay in touch with your childrenâ€™s teacher or school to stay informed, ask questions and get more guidance. If you are struggling or know someone who is struggling with school work or the home situation, please discuss this with a teacher that you feel close to. Parent groups or community groups can also be a good way to support each other with your home schooling."

        "Option 5: Support your child when they return to school": {
          "Message": "Step 5. Support your child when they go back to school\n\nTell your child that it is okay to feel scared or worried about going back to school. Allow your child to share how they are feeling. It is also normal if your child behaves different to their usual behaviour. Discuss how going to school might be different and how they can protect themselves from COVID-19. Ask them how their day went and support them if they experienced any difficulties."
