For example, walking, jogging, soccer or dancing\n•\tPick one together and try it out. \n•\tIf you both like it, decide how often you are going to do it. Once or twice a week? Every morning?\n•\tTogether think of ways to make it even more fun. Can you jog to a certain point? Take turns in being the coach? Motivate each other with a small free reward? "
