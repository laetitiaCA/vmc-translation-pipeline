        "Message": "Giving calm consequences help teach our children responsibility for what they do. They also allow discipline that is controlled. This is more effective than hitting or shouting. \n\nHere are 5 tips for using consequences:\n\n",
        "Option 1: Give a choice before consequence": {
          "Message": "1. Give your child a choice to follow your instruction before giving them the consequence."
        },
        "Option 2: Stay calm but be firm": {
          "Message": "2. Try to stay calm but firm when giving the consequence.\nIf you start yelling, it will just make things worse. Take a deep breath before you speak in a clear, calm, and firm voice."
        },
        "Option 3: Be realistic and follow through": {
          "Message": "3. Be realistic and follow through\nMake sure you can follow through with the consequence. For example, taking away a teenager’s phone for a week is hard to enforce. Taking it away for one hour is more realistic."
        },
        "Option 4: Reconnect afterwards": {
          "Message": "4. Reconnect afterwards. \nOnce the consequence is over, give your child a chance to do something good, and praise them for it."
        },
        "Option 5: Consequences for breaking rules": {
          "Message 1": "5. Consequences for breaking rules\nConsequences can also be used when your children forget a household rule, like going to bed at a certain hour or doing schoolwork before T.V.",
          "Message 2": "For example, you can tell your child that if they do not do their schoolwork before dinner, they cannot watch their favourite T.V. show that evening."

      "Set of messages 2": {
        "Message 1": "Here is a comic that shows a parent giving their child a choice to follow the instruction or receive a consequence.",
        "Message 2": "Well done! You have added another skill to your Parenting Toolkit! In summary, consequences should be...\n\n1. Realistic: Consider the age of your child\n2. Immediate: Give them as soon as possible\n3. Fair: Make sure the consequence is not too harsh\n4. Consistent: Make sure you can follow through if you have to\n5. The last resort: Try to encourage the positive behaviour to happen more often!\n\nConsequences can help children learn that their actions have an impact on themselves and others. It teaches them about responsibility and respect!"
