        "Message": "Pass the Snap  \n•\tThis game is best with at least 3 people\n•\tStart in a circle and pass one snap around the circle (or clap if you cannot snap)\n•\tYou snap once to throw the snap and once to catch it. Look at the person you are throwing to.  \n•\tThe direction (up, down, straight, curved, rolling the ground) and force (hard, soft, medium) that you throw the snap should affect how the person catches it.  \n•\tYou can bounce the snap, throw it in the air, and catch it a few times before passing it.  \n•\tWhen everyone gets good at this, you can start moving around the room, still passing the snap.  \n•\tCan you throw under the leg?  Behind the back?  Through your head?  Intercept a pass? Have fun with the snap!  "
