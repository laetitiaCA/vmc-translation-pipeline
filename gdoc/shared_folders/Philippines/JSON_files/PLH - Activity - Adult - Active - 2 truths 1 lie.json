        "Message": "2 Truths, 1 Lie\n•\tThink of three statements about yourself. Two must be true and one must be a lie.\n•\tIt might help to think of wishes, dreams, likes or dislikes. For example, I hate bananas, I love ice cream and I really wish I could sing. \n•\tSay them to your partner or friends. Ask them to guess which one is a lie. \n•\tDid they guess correctly? Was it a surprise?\n•\tNow ask them to do the same. Did you learn something new about each other? "
