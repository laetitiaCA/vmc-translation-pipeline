        "Option 1: Spend at least five minutes with each child": {
          "Message": "1. Spend at least five minutes with each child\nEven 5 minutes a day of quality time  makes a big difference. If you have more than one child, you can take turns or let each child choose an activity. It can be at the same time each day so your children look forward to it."
        },
        "Option 2: Give your child your full attention": {
          "Message": "2. Give your child your full attention\nMake sure you will not be interrupted. Switch off the TV and put your phone on silent. It will show your child, they are important."
        },
        "Option 3: Let your child choose the activity": {
          "Message 1": "3. Let your child choose the activity\nAsk your child what they would like to do. You can say, \"I have 5 minutes to spend One-on-One Time with you, what would you like to do?",
          "Message 2": "Choosing builds their self confidence. If they want to do something that isnâ€™t OK with COVID-19 rules, then this is a chance to talk with them about this.",
          "Message 3": "If your child cannot think of anything, you can give them a choice of a couple things that you know they like."
        },
        "Option 4: Follow your child's lead": {
          "Message": "4. Follow your child's lead\nChildren need to do things in their own time. Try to give them time to explore and be patient. Play alongside and copy what they are doing but try to let them keep the initiative."
        },
        "Option 5: Use words to describe what your child is doing": {
          "Message": "5. Use words to describe what your child is doing\nListening to your child is more important than talking to them at this time. If you do talk you should describe what your child is doing. Use words to describe actions, colours, shapes, numbers, sizes, textures, temperatures, tastes, sounds, and anything else that is happening!"
        },
        "Option 6: Have fun!": {
          "Message": "6. Have fun!\nOne-on-One Time with your child can be fun for you, too! You might even find that you feel less stressed after playing with your child."
