Content,Positive,CheckIn,Ignore,"I know, it can be really difficult to stay calm when our children are whining or having a tantrum. Try to think of something that you can do to help like taking a pause. You can do this!",,,,,,,,,,,PLH - Content - Positive - CheckIn - Ignore,33d20251-941d-499f-b2d2-7fd1a013dd62,6a5b7a3c-a9f3-47f5-b928-bf413295652b

Content,Positive,CheckIn,Ignore,"Sometimes, our children can have very violent tantrums when they do not get their way, especially if they are used to it. Try to move your child to a place where they will not hurt themselves or others. You may need to firmly hold your child while ignoring their behaviour - but only do this if you can remain calm and  make sure you are not hurting them! Eventually, your child will calm down.",,,,,,,,,,,PLH - Content - Positive - CheckIn - Ignore,33d20251-941d-499f-b2d2-7fd1a013dd62,2ac25060-cc8a-473c-84f5-884bf947b00a
Content,Positive,CheckIn,Ignore,"I know, it is hard to be consistent! If you ignore a behaviour only some of the time, your child will think it might help them get their way.
